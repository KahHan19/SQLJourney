# SQLJourney


Here include the journey and resources I used to self learn HTML and CSS.<br>
Resources Used:
1. MySQL
3. GitHub Dekstop (For code upload)
<br>

<hr>
Beginner Notes:<br>
- Most Command such as Select, Distinct and .. are not case sensitive.



1. Select - allows you to select the specific column interested ("*" - All columns) 
2. From - Which dataset are you extracting information from.

example:
SELECT * from parks_and_recreation.employee_salary;

This SELECt everything(*) from the "parks_and_recreation.employee_salary" dataset and ";" indicates end of code.
