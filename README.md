## Resources Used

## Beginner Notes

- Most commands such as `SELECT`, `DISTINCT`, and others are not case sensitive.

### Basic SQL Commands
1. **SELECT** - Allows you to select the specific column of interest (`*` selects all columns).
2. **FROM** - Specifies the dataset from which you are extracting information.
3. **";"** - Represent end of code.

#### Example:

```sql
SELECT * FROM parks_and_recreation.employee_salary;
SELECT first_name, salary, salary*2 FROM parks_and_recreation.employee_salary;
````

The second line showcases extract specific column such as first_name, salary and the value of salary*2. ( In another words it enables addition column with extract processing. )
