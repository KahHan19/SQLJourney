# SQLJourney

Here, I include the journey and resources I used to self-learn HTML and CSS.

## Resources Used
1. MySQL
2. GitHub Desktop (For code upload)

## Beginner Notes

- Most commands such as `SELECT`, `DISTINCT`, and others are not case sensitive.

### Basic SQL Commands
1. **SELECT** - Allows you to select the specific column of interest (`*` selects all columns).
2. **FROM** - Specifies the dataset from which you are extracting information.

#### Example:

```sql
SELECT * FROM parks_and_recreation.employee_salary;
